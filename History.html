           <p>Welcome to the History page. Here is some brief history about the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns.</p>

                <hr><u><b>Milwaukee Bucks:</b></u>
            </div>
        </p>
        <div class= "bucks">
            <p>The Milwaukee Bucks are a basketball team that was formed on January 22nd, 1968. During the time, the general managers were Wesley D. Pavalon and Marvin L. Fishman, both who watched over the picks that went through during the expansion draft with the Phoenix Suns. After the draft, the Bucks picked up players such as Bud Olsen and Gary Gray, and headed into the season.</p>
            <p>During their first game, the Milwaukee Bucks played against the Chicago Bulls and had 8,467 fans in the Milwaukee stadium. The team lost to the Bulls, and soon struggled during the 1969 season, which made no surprise to many fans. The team resulted in winning 26 games, while losing 56 of them.</p>
            <p>In 1969, since both Milwaukee and the Phoenix Suns were the worst teams in the NBA, that resulted in a coin toss to see who would select the #1 pick in the draft, who was undoubtbly going to be Lew Alcindor, aka Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Luckly, for the Bucks, they won the coin toss and got their guy from UCLA. This new addition on the team played a major role in the record change in the 1970 season, where the Bucks won 56 games and lossed 26 games. This resulted in the team to making the Playoffs and going as far to making the NBA Finals. But, they lost to the New York Knicks in five games.</p>

            <p>The 1971 season you can say was a dream for the Bucks. They made the playoffs again with a 66-10 record and even won the finals with a star combined duo of Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robinson. They made history as the first team to quickly win a NBA championship after entering the NBA.</p>
            <p>Now, let's fast forward to 1996, whcih is a big jump. We now are going to see a current day retired Hall of Famer get traded to the Bucks. During draft night, the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted Ray Allen, known as Jesus Shuttlesworth, with the 5th pick in the 1996 Draft, but later traded him for a 1998 first round pick, which became Rasho Nesterovic, and the rights to Stephon Marbury. The team didn't make the playoffs that year, but Ray Allen made All-Rookie first team, which was a bright sight for the future. Two years later, Allen became an NBA All-Star. The shooting guard spent a good amount of years on the Bucks, but was soon traded to the Seattle Supersonics, known today as the Oklahoma City Thunder, during the 2003 season. Today, Allen's jersey isn't retired by the team, but he will be known as a legend to play for the Bucks.</p>
            <p>In 2013, the Bucks finished with a 38-44 record, which led them to the NBA Playoffs. But, they lossed the series to the Miami Heat. It wasn't a total loss for the franchise, as they soon drafted their next franchise player with the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA Draft: Giannis Antetokounmpo. </p>

            <p>Giannis scored 6.8 points per game in his first season, while also putting up 4.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists. The team finished 15-67 and didn't make the Playoffs. Giannis improved from their and scored 12.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists. The Bucks made the Playoffs in 2015, but lost to the Chicago Bulls. Each year, Antetokounmpo kept improving, and even won Most Improved Player in 2017. Two years later, he won Most Valuable Player and led his team to the Playoffs. He is the main reason why the Bucks won the 2021 NBA Finals.</p>

                <hr><u><b>Phoenix Suns:</b></u>
            </div>
        </p>
        <div class= "suns">
            <p>The Phoenix Suns are a basketball team that was formed on January 22nd, 1968. During the time, the general manager was Jerry Colangelo, a former scout for the Chicago Bulls. He was only 28-years-old, becoming the youngest person to manage a team. He was also a figure that wanted to make his team a direct winner, which could be seen when he was drafting players for his team with the Bucks. After the expansion draft, the Suns picked up players such as Gail Goodrich and Dennis Hamilton, and headed into the season.</p>
            <p>During their first game, the Phoenix Suns played against the Seattle Supersonics, with the result of the Suns winning with 116 points, while the Sonics lossed with 107 points. After that win, the road didn't go so smoothly for the team. They finished with a 16-66 record.</p>
            <p>Like the Bucks, the Suns entered the coin toss to see who would get the #1 pick. Unfortunately, for the Suns, they lossed the coin toss and ended up with the #2 pick, which isn't bad. In the 1969 draft, after the Bucks took Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Suns drafted Neal Walk from Florida University. The new addition didn't have a crucial role, but the team made the playoffs with a 39-43 record. Soon later, they lost to the Los Angelas Lakers in seven games.</p>
            <p>During the 1976 season, the Phoenix Suns made the Playoffs with a 42-40 record, thanks to Paul Westphal. The team even went far to the NBA Finals. Their luck soon ended when they went up against the Boston Celtics, who defeated them in six games.</p>
            <p>Let's fast forward to 1996 again, where the Phoenix Suns also drafted a former current day Hall of Famer, who is known as one of the best shooters of all time: Steve Nash. Nash went 15th in the draft and wore #13 for the team. During his first year for the team, Nash put up 3.3 points, 1 rebound, and 2.2 assists. He didn't have a big role for the team then, but the Suns made the playoffs, but lost against the Sonics in five games. The future was bright for Nash after that, as each year he kept improving. After his second season, he was traded in 1998 on Draft Night to the Dallas Mavericks. He later came back before the start of the 2005 season, and ended of earning an MVP back to back in 2005 and 2006. Today, he is in the Hall of Fame, with his jersey hangs up in the rafters, while also being known as the greatest Suns player in history.</p>

            <p>In 2015, the Suns drafted again their franchise player with the 13th pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. They selected Devin Booker from the University of Kentucky. In the 2016 season, he made All-Rookie First Team, averaging 13.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.6 assists. His team didn't make the playoffs that year, putting up a 23-59 record. Inn the 2017 season, Booker balled up, scoring 70 points in a game and averaging 22.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 3.4 assists. The team went 24-58 and was last in the West. Each year, though, Booker kept getting better, and even became an All-Star in 2020, the year he performed in the Bubble. With the help of Booker, and teammates such as Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton, they proved the doubters wrong and the Phoenix Suns made the NBA Finals and competed competitively to keep up with the Bucks.</p>
