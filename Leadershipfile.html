            <u>What is Leadership?:</u>
            <br>In the Hidden Genius Project, on our first day, we deeply discussed the idea of leadership. To me, leadership is carrying a community and always being the one that takes the first step in any situations, making others feel comfortable. Leadership is also the idea of helping out in different communities and making sure that people they're working with are ready to pitch in.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Personal Reflections:</u>
            <br>During leadership classes, the Youth Educator's in the Hidden Genius Project would give us questions that would deeply reflect on ourselves. This was one of my favorite assignments because it gave me the opportunity to just think about who I really am and how to make myself better.

            <u>What is the 4th to the Negro?:</u> 
            <br>Words by the famous Abolitionist, conductor, and author Frederick Douglass. After the United States "holiday" 4th of July was celebrated, we came back to class discussing what this day means to us. To me, it's just a regular day. Nothing more, nothing less. I shouldn't celebrate a day where my ancestors weren't even freed, when they were still working in the fields while the people of America celebrated their independance from the British. Not ours, but theirs. The 4th is really just a meaningless day to an African American, which is what Frederick Douglass thought as well. It's just known as the day where African Americans weren't freed and had to wait until June 19th, 1865 to actually be freed.

        <p>
            <u>Self Care:</u>
            <br>For this assignment, we discussed the stress that we have to deal with in our lives and ways that we handle it. For me, my stress used to be high due to dealing with school, extra-curriculer activities, and my mental health. Discussing ways that we take care of ourselves physically and mentally was something that I really enjoyed and felt grateful of doing in the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Knowledge Circles:</u>
            <br>Knowledge Circles were just times where we were given different questions and we had to give answers to them based on our familiarity on them. Some questions that we were given were to define Pan-Africanism, while also identifying the achievements LeBron James made that weren't just basketball related. A lot of people who know me can think of me as someone who likes to talk. So, giving my thoughts to differnet questions that were given in class was something I enjoyed.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Goal Setting:</u>
            <br>The YE's in the Hidden Genius Project asked each student in our cohort, which is Oak9Gold, to write down our goals that we want to aim for and reach, while also writing different obstacles that might be in our way and think about different methods on how to solve them. The goal that I set for myself is to get straight A's at the high school I'm attending. And, even though I know it will be hard, I am still going to pursue that focus.
